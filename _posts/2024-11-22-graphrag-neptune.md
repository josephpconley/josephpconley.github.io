I really enjoyed my recent talk as part of the monthly [Greater Philadelphia AWS User Group](https://www.meetup.com/gpawsug/) at [SID Global Solutions](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sid-global-solutions-it-consulting-&-training-/). 

While I've mostly built basic RAG solutions so far as part of the Fractional CTO work I'm doing at [TechSight](https://techsight.dev), it was fun taking some time to explore the potential behind graphs and how their inherent structure can improve quality and traceability.

Here are the slides, reach out if you wanna chat further!
