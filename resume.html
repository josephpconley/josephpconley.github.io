    Dear Recruiters,
</p>
<p>
    I'm posting my resume here for reference (LinkedIn is most likely to be up-to-date).
    I typically ignore unsolicited recruiting e-mails, and have a few e-mail filters which (hopefully) filter out any such attempts from my inbox.
</p>
<p>
    I <b>really really really</b> don't like getting cold calls from a recruiter.  They almost always happen right when
    I'm in the middle of writing code or trying to enter some "deep work" state.  You've been warned!
</p>
<p>
    Thanks in advance for your consideration!
