- Serving as a Fractional CTO for startups/PE funds, enjoying the challenging and diverse work focusing on software architecture at scale, process engineering, and deep dives into interesting verticals!
- Wrapping up work on an upcoming book, Data Analytics on AWS. Should hit bookshelves by mid-March!
- On the lookout for interesting SaaS companies to invest in, if you know of any drop me a line!
- Spending more time reading 10-Ks/10-Qs of late, not really for active investing but moreso to learn about interesting companies and industries
- Enjoying being fully remote and spending time with these crazy guys!
