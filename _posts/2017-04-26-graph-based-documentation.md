Has anyone ever met a documentation system they both *liked* and found *useful*?  I love Evernote as much as the next guy but the simple list view has its limitations.
Most wikis present information in a tree view where pages are restricted to a parent-child relationship.  Neither are very useful or intuitive for documenting complex systems!

I'm a very visual thinker.  I know from experience that when dealing with several layers of abstraction,
having a good visualization can be very helpful.  And when I say **good**, I mean **good** in the sense
that the visualization is **as close to reality as possible**.  Shane Parrish and others remind us that 
[the map is not the territory](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2015/11/map-and-territory/), but we can get pretty damn close.
And I think graphs can help ([so does neo4j, shockingly](https://neo4j.com/blog/technical-documentation-graph/)).
Because it's 2017, and we deserve more optimal ways to visualize ideas and systems.

Why graphs?  Graphs are inherently simple.  There are nodes and edges.  That's it.  Nodes represent a "thing", edges represent
a "relationship between things".  There's no parent-child restriction; any node can be related to any other node. 
Visually, the relationships can be shown compactly and the information structure is more flexible.
Using this as our foundation, we can start to build something useful.

So, here's what I've got so far.  I'm calling it *Episteme* (from the Greek for 
["knowledge, science, or understanding"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episteme)).
It's a desktop app powered by [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) and is a simple graph of nodes and edges where nodes are some entity we want to document.
Here's an example based on my current [SwingStats](http://www.swingstats.com/about) architecture:

Here the nodes represent backend services, webapps, datasources, and APIs while the edges connect the nodes that interact in some way.
Clicking on each node will bring up a Markdown-based document which will autosave on edit:

I've already been using it at my current client to help me navigate the dozens of systems and their interactions.
I've found the most value in quickly accessing common commands (SQL, ssh, docker, etc.), environment information 
and links.  It's definitely sped up development time as I don't need to constantly search Confluence or Google for 
rote memory stuff like query syntax.  It just feels like the information is much closer at hand.

I'm hoping to add some functionality to make it more context-driven.  I think tagging nodes would serve well here, depending
on what project/context I'm working on I could filter the graph by tags to only show relevant nodes.
As the graph grows, having a "Jump To" button for nodes would be nice.  Full-text search is probably inevitable too.

Another interesting extension would be having teams share and collaborate on the graph.  Maybe in a Git-based system with a fork/clone model so you
get version control for free and can see how the graph evolves over time?  Throw in some live documentation a la [Swagger](http://swagger.io/)
and baby you've got a stew going!

One cool thing to note is it took me five hours to get a useful protoype working, and most of that time was spent learning Electron.  
I've spent a few more hours on refinements but [vis.js](http://visjs.org/) and [SimpleMDE](https://simplemde.com/) do all the heavy lifting, and 
the graph is persisted as a simple JSON file for now.  And I'm not a master front-end developer by any stretch of the imagination so if you have an idea,
find some good tools that get you most of the way there and kick the tires!
