I'm very proud to announce the publication of my first book, [Advanced Data Analytics with AWS](https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Data-Analytics-AWS-Engineering/dp/8197081891)!

I've spent most of my career in tech working with data in all shapes and sizes, more recently in the cloud on AWS. And while I know how daunting AWS can be to knowledge workers across all levels of experience, I felt it was worthwhile to offer a foundational overview of how to build data analytics pipelines on (arguably) the de facto operating system for modern software.

Enjoy! Please let me know if you have any feedback at all!
