    In addition to the code I've written (the public stuff you can find on my <a href="http://www.github.com/josephpconley" target="_blank">Github</a>),
here are some random tools and things I've built over the years.  Most of the recent stuff has been built using <a href="www.datacombinator.com" target="_blank">DataCombinator</a>
to handle the backend data integration and minimal UI requirements
</p>

<h2>Patents</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
	<a href="https://patents.justia.com/patent/11537964">Anti-monotony system and method associated with new home construction in a master-planned community</a> - developed for The XO at Cecilian Partners
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Twitter Bots</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="http://twitter.com/birdie_bot" target="_blank">BirdieBot</a>
        - easily my most popular bot, I had wanted to experiment with my unofficial PGATour datasource.
        Turns out that the DFS fantasy crowd took a liking to this one.
        I'm still trying to generalize the concept to give users more power to filter out streams of data
        (see <a href="/2016/04/08/atomic-events-pgastream.html">Atomic Events and PGAStream</a>).
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://twitter.com/owgrbot" target="_blank">OWGRWeekly</a>
        - uses another "unofficial" datasource to tweet the latest Official World Golf Rankings every Monday morning.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://twitter.com/did76erscover" target="_blank">Did the Sixers Cover?</a>
        - takes the nightly NBA scores and odds to determine if my hometown Sixers covered the spread for that day's game.  I promise you I don't have a gambling problem.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://twitter.com/wofspin" target="_blank">WOF Spin ID</a>
        - who has time to watch Wheel of Fortune every night?  Follow this one to find out the latest spin ID (currently down due to a bad datasource).
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Search Engines</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="http://datacombinator.com/app/books/search">Book Search Engine</a> -
        I use this ALL the time.  Anytime I come across a good book recommendation, I search here first as it gathers info from my two local libraries,
        Google Play, and Hoopla.  Would eventually like to integrate Kindle as well.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://datacombinator.com/app/movies/search">Movie Search Engine</a> -
        Nice integrated search over several different movie sites and APIs for a movie's availability.  Works pretty well!
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>RSS Feeds</h2>
<p>
    I've built quite a few RSS feeds with DataCombinator, and am still doing do on a regular basis.  Here are a few of the more useful ones.
    Most of the ones I've built are based on HTML scraping so there's always a chance that the scraping logic will need to be updated as the
    target site HTML changes.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Github Issues</b> - using a backend Github API integration, I converted the Issues API to an RSS format.
        Works for any public repo on Github.  You have to pass the `org` and `repo` parameters to specify the organization and repository name,
        the rest of the parameters are the same you'd pass to filter issues on Github.

        e.g. <a href="http://www.datacombinator.com/api/github/issues.rss?org=lagom&repo=lagom&state=open&sort=created" target="_blank">http://www.datacombinator.com/api/github/issues.rss?org=lagom&repo=lagom&state=open&sort=created</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://www.datacombinator.com/api/nyt/articles.rss?author=andrew-ross-sorkin" target="_blank">Latest NYT Author Articles</a>
        - I wrote this specifically to follow Andrew Ross Sorkin articles, I like his work and the other RSS feeds purporting
        to have his latest and greatest weren't working.  It's actually a generalized feed for any NYT author,
        just find their slug id (e.g. Aaron's is `andrew-ross-sorkin`) and plug in to the url,
        e.g. <a href="http://www.datacombinator.com/api/nyt/articles.rss?author=thomas-l-friedman">http://www.datacombinator.com/api/nyt/articles.rss?author=thomas-l-friedman</a>
        for Thomas Friedman.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>SwingStats</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.swingstats.com" target="_blank">Free app</a> to track your golf handicap.  I also use it to run my Golf Majors Pool.</p>
