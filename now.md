<h1>What I'm Doing Now</h1>
<small>Inspired by <a href="http://nownownow.com/about">Derek Sivers</a><br>

    
- Serving as Product CTO for [Trilogy](https://www.linkedin.com/company/trilogy/mycompany/), enjoying the challenging and diverse work focusing on software architecture at scale, process engineering, and deep dives into interesting verticals!
- On the lookout for interesting SaaS companies to invest in, if you know of any drop me a line!
- Spending more time reading 10-Ks/10-Qs of late, not really for active investing but moreso to learn about interesting companies and industries
- Enjoying being fully remote and spending time with these crazy guys!
