I've seen, and been part of, software teams that remind me of this great Simpsons quote (my edits in italics):

> You know __software with users__ is like the mule with a spinning wheel. No one knows how they got 'em, and danged if they know how to __serve__ 'em!

It's easy as a team to get distracted by your own internal struggles with process, tech debt, and technical debates over languages and frameworks. You can often forget that the ultimate goal of a software team is **to provide a service**, specifically by delivering working software. The quality and speed of this service is important, and the ultimate goal is to provide some level of value to the software's end-user that they couldn't find otherwise.

Though most engineers probably won't attend sales calls or talk to users directly, the quality of their code still impacts those end-users, and that perspective has to be front of mind as they build out their product.

A previous manager of mine, struggling with a team's delivery issues, had everyone think through the example of a pizza shop.

> Think of our team as a pizza shop. Pizza shops need to deliver quality pizza. They also need to deliver quality pizza in a reasonable amount of time.  
If we take forever to make pizzas, customers will leave. If the pizza we make tastes like shit, customers will leave. If customers leave, we can't afford to keep making pizzas and we all go home.

Customers don't care which toppings your team prefers (Python, Java, Rust). They also don't care how the pizza gets delivered (Agile bike delivery or Waterfall waiters). They're hungry!

I think understanding this idea from a ground level really helps add an important perspective to any work you do. Architecture decisions are important, but the customer experience should also be a first-class citizen too. 

Here's some ideas to help break out of the silo:

- Gather feedback **quickly and iteratively** from customers, rather than build something in isolation for months
- **Use data**, not guesses, to figure out what the customer actually uses and where they get stuck
- Focus on the **high leverage points** in the product that lead to the highest possible quality.

There's probably other principles that result from this, but the main point is where these principles come from - a focus on the customer.

So take pride in your pizza! Think of ways to make it better and faster. And don't be afraid to ask users how it tastes, you never know when you might learn something new.
