- bought more $HIFS and $PAR - hopefully those moves are greeted by [yawns](https://www.in.kpmg.com/SecureData/aci/Files/agendaissue5.pdf)
- added Lumine Group $LMGIF via dividend from Constellation - not sure if I want to add any more yet, have to do the homework.  Their concentration of companies focused on selling to enterprises is interesting though.
- watched the ever-volatile $SKYH price roughly 2.5x, might be a bit over-priced today but long-term the prospects still seem sound so no reason to trim 

Looking to do a deeper dive into $HIFS and $NU in the midst of the banking turmoil to understand how they're positioned and if there's any additional opportunity there.  Should be fun learnings either way!
